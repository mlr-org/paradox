\title{Create a ParamSet from a list of ParamSets}
\usage{
ps_union(sets, tag_sets = FALSE, tag_params = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{sets:}{list of ParamSet}
}
\description{
This emulates \code{ParamSetCollection$new(sets)}, except that
\itemize{
\item The result is a \code{ParamSet}, not a \code{ParamSetCollection}
\item The ParamSets are allowed to have \verb{$trafo}, which are collected together into a single function.
This emulates \code{ParamSetCollection$new(sets)}, which in particular means that the resulting ParamSet has all the Params
from the input \code{sets}, but some \verb{$id}s are changed: If the ParamSet has a non-empty \code{set_id}, then the Params will
have their \if{html}{\out{<id>}} changed to <set_id>.\if{html}{\out{<id>}}. This is also reflected in deps and in \verb{$trafo}.
