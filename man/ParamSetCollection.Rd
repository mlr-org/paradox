\description{
A collection of multiple \link{ParamSet} objects.
\itemize{
\item The collection is basically a light-weight wrapper / container around references to multiple sets.
\item In order to ensure unique param names, every param in the collection is referred to with
"<set_id>.<param_id>".
\item The following state-changing methods are not allowed for a collection: \code{add}, \code{subset}.
\item When you either ask for 'values' or set them, the operation is delegated to the individual,
contained param set references. The collection itself does not maintain a \code{values} state.
This also implies that if you directly change \code{values} in one of the referenced sets,
this change is reflected in the collection.
